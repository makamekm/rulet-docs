By continuing to use the service:

* I confirm that I am 18 years of age or older
* I accept the [User Agreement](./agreement.md) and [Rules](./rules.md)
* I agree to the processing of my personal data in accordance with the terms of the [Privacy Policy](./politics.md)
* By using our service, you accept our terms of filing complaints:
  Violation of the terms of the user agreement and (or) these rules by the User entails blocking of the User account (ban). A ban can be imposed based on a complaint from the User   or if the violation is recorded by the Service administration.

  The User can send a complaint about their interlocutor. Along with the complaint, the moderators receive a screenshot of the video interlocutor. The moderators check each    complaint for a possible violation and decide whether it requires banning the interlocutor from the Service. Moderators monitor user complaints 24/7, including weekends and   holidays. The moderator responds to the complaint within 24 hours.

  Our system automatically blocks any user who receives multiple complaints within a short time. This helps to identify violations that are difficult to detect in other ways. The    system takes into account many factors that exclude accidental or unjustified bans.
* Claims, reasoned refusals, objections and notifications are sent to the Service Owner by e-mail help@rulet.tv.
