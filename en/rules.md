- The User can send a complaint about their interlocutor. Along with the complaint, moderators receive a screenshot of the video interlocutor and their message (if any). Moderators check each complaint for a possible violation and decide whether it requires banning the interlocutor from the Service. Moderators monitor user complaints 24/7, including weekends and holidays.
- Our system automatically blocks any user who receives multiple complaints within a short time. This helps to identify violations that are difficult to detect in other ways. The system takes into account many factors that exclude accidental or unjustified bans.
- By using our service, you accept our terms for filing complaints. Remember that other users can also send complaints about you, which can lead to an automatic ban.
- If your interlocutor violates the chat rules or behaves offensively towards you, it is recommended not to respond with an insult or violation. If you do so, you will become an offender and can be banned.
- The User account is blocked (banned) for up to 365 days.
