# Child Abuse Policy

We prohibit the use of app to endanger children. This includes but is not limited to use of apps to promote predatory behavior towards children, such as:

* Inappropriate interaction targeted at a child (for example, groping or caressing);
* Child grooming (for example, befriending a child online to facilitate, either online or offline, sexual contact and/or exchanging sexual imagery with that child);
* Sexualization of a minor (for example, imagery that depicts, encourages or promotes the sexual abuse of children or the portrayal of children in a manner that could result in the sexual exploitation of children);
* Sextortion (for example, threatening or blackmailing a child by using real or alleged access to a childâ€™s intimate images);
* Trafficking of a child (for example, advertising or solicitation of a child for commercial sexual exploitation).

If you find a content that is sexually abusive towards children, you have to send report about such content or send your questions to help@rulet.tv. If such materials are found in the application, they will be immediately deleted.

The app complies with applicable child safety laws and regulations, including but not limited to, having a process in place to report confirmed CSAM to the police or your relevant regional authority.
